## About this app
This is an API driven app, created to be as flexible as possible, using React and TypeScript.
While the backend has validation, the front-end does as well and doesn't allow for API-calls to be made if the validation isn't right, I don't want to give the server any extra work to do that it shouldn't.
But it does mean extra upkeep, but it looks faster to the user and it can improve their experience. The app should give a nice flow-experience for the user, keeping them up to date and keep clicks to a minimum.

Different types of inputs have been turned into different components, to allow for more flexibility and re-usability depending on the needs (as example; `<NumberFieldComponent />` and `<TextFieldComponent />`
Typing has only been used where the IDE couldn't infer the typing itself. Logic has been extracted out of the components as much as possible for re-usability when necessary in the future (added projects with new libraries or frameworks as example)

The client is generated by using the Swagger.json file generated by the server. I created an extra layer there to make renaming of api-calls easier. A single point to have name changes if the server needs to change its controller name or turn a get into a post, etc. Instead of having web push notifications I opted for a simpler approach of pinging the server to see if changes in the waiting list have occured or whether they can check in.

Jest is used for testing; `npm test`, testing important things such as rendering, validating and showing the correct text.
